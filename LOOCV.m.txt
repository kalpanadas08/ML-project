function [accuracy, confusion] = LOOCV(net, X, D)
%  we get the mean accuracy of a neural network with the leave-one-out cross-validation technique
%  the inputs are the neural network, the database and labels
%  since LOOCV is a special case of K-fold cross validation, where K is equal to the database size, we just reuse the K-fold function
    [accuracy, confusion] = k_fold_CV(net, X, D, size(X, 2));
